# ArtPreviewGenerator

Two example scenes are included. They consist of a foreground "frame", a layer with a transparent section to allow the art to show through, and an artwork layer which is really just a smart object of the correct artwork size.

To use, open the PSD and select the artwork layer. Navigate to File --> Scripts --> Browse and load the jsx file. Choose the images you want to bulk generate art for. When you click "OK", the script will generate the images and save them as JPEG, quality 12, in the same folder as the PSD scene. A few outputs files are included.
